This repository is open for all contributions. Any kind of updations, additions, modifications and any other form of contribution is welcome. In case you're new to open source and contributing, be sure to read about [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#:~:text=GitHub%20is%20a%20code%20hosting,%2C%20commits%2C%20and%20Pull%20Requests.), [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/), [GitHub Open Source](https://github.com/open-source), and you are encouraged to check [OpenSource.Guide](http://opensource.guide/).

Alongside, please feel free to open new issues and pull requests.

Every contribution counts, and will go a long way towards betterment of the code and/or its related files.

### Essential steps to get contributing

To be able to contribute to this repository with [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), be sure to fork this repository from the fork option at the top-right of this repository, if not yet done. Your forked repository is from where you'll initiate (and later update, if needed) your pull requests from.

Go to your forked repository to add and update files for improvisation. 
Now, you can do this either directly from [GitHub Website](https://github.com), or by using [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) ([Command Line Interface](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git)).

After cloning the repository, please read and understand what the existing code or document is meant for, before overwriting it with your changes. If you're unsure about any part, feel free to ask it in discussions, and we'd be happy to help.

Here's a summary of essential steps when using [CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git), just to keep you in flow, and to ensure that you don't miss on any of the necessary steps:

1. Star (Optional, will help you in staying up-to-date with the base repository) and Fork this repository.
2. `git clone <Your_Forked_Repo_URL_Here>` (This will download and save a folder for your existing repository, locally in your machine.) 
3. Check existing files, and make your desired updations.
4. `git checkout -b <newBranch>` (Optional step, but helpful in case where multiple active pull requests are expected)
5. `git add .` or `git add -A` (This adds all the files for tracking and including in the next commit)
6. `git commit -m "<Your One-Liner Commit Message>"` (This commits your changes locally)
7. `git pull` or `git pull --set-upstream origin <branchName>` (This pulls any further changes from the server and ensures that the local repository is again up-to-date with the host repository)
8. `git push` or `git push origin <branchName>` (This pushes your changes to the repository)

After following these steps in Git CLI (in order), you'll need to go to your GitHub repository in the website to initiate a new Pull Request.
