## About 

This program creates a random string of specified length using a combination of the following:
`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%&*`

## Usage 

#### Requirement - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) should be installed

Assuming that Node is already configured on your system, the code can be run as soon as it is cloned. Change your terminal directory to the cloned repo and run:

```
node generator.js <length>
``` 

Where length is an int. For example:
```
node generator.js 20
``` 
Results in: `K!orbFtveZ&jLcxjLQdk`
```
node generator.js 16
``` 
Results in: `RuMB$qyjv&8v7jdr`
```
node generator.js 5
``` 
Results in: `E&!z6`
